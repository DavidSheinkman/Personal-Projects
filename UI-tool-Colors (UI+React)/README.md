# UI - Complementary Colors Generation

The web tool is a user-friendly UI tool designed to assist both designers and developers in optimizing colors for their projects. The tool specializes in generating visually appealing complementary color palettes while also providing a valuable contrast optimization feature.

Complementary Colors Generation:
The web tool utilizes the fundamental principles of color theory to generate complementary color palettes. Complementary colors are pairs of colors that are located opposite each other on the color wheel. When combined, they create a high-contrast and visually striking effect.

The color wheel, also known as the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color wheel, is a circular representation of colors where the primary colors (red, green, and blue) are evenly spaced. Opposite colors on the color wheel exhibit a strong visual contrast, making them an ideal choice for creating vibrant designs.

The web tool takes a base color selected by the user and calculates its complementary color by finding the color located exactly 180 degrees away on the color wheel. This process ensures that the generated complementary color harmonizes perfectly with the chosen base color, resulting in a balanced and visually appealing palette.

# UX - Contrast Optimization

The web tool places a strong emphasis on contrast optimization to ensure that the color combinations used in your designs are accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments. Low contrast between text and background can be challenging for individuals with visual difficulties, impacting readability and overall user experience.

With the web tool's contrast optimization feature, designers and developers can adjust the color contrast of text and background elements to meet accessibility standards. The tool calculates the contrast ratio between the foreground (text) and background colors, helping you select color combinations that comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and are easy to read for all users.

By incorporating contrast optimization into your design workflow, you demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, making your projects more user-friendly and welcoming to a broader audience.
